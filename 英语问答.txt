                        结构：If + 主语 + had + 过去分词，主语 + would/could/might + have + 过去分词
                        例句：If he had studied harder, he would have passed the exam. (如果他更努力学习，他就会通过考试。)

                        3.与将来事实相反的假设：
                        结构：If + 主语 + were to + 动词原形，主语 + would/could/might + 动词原形
